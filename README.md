## Ordinals
Ordinals is a two-player game where the goal is to get a sequence of numbered cards in order from lowest to highest. On each turn, you can replace a card in your hand, but not reposition any cards.

## Scoring
You get 5 points for every card from the start that is in order. You do not earn points for cards at later indexes being in order if one before that is not in order. For example:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 -> 50 points

2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 -> 0 points

1, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12 -> 5 points

Compete against the robot and win!
